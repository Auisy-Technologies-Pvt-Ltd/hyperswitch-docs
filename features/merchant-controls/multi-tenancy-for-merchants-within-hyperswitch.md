## Key Benefits of Multi-Tenancy in Hyperswitch

* **Streamlined Operations**: A centralized dashboard lets you view, manage, and optimize payment processes across brands.

### **Customizable Payment Options for Each Brand**

Each entity or brand under a business can have its own unique payment methods, gateways, and rules. This allows businesses to localize payment options for different markets or offer tailored solutions for specific customer segments.

* **Brand-Specific Gateways**: Choose the right payment processor or gateway for each brand.
* **Localized Payment Methods**: Easily support local payment methods, currencies, or regional rules for different tenants.

### **Unified Reporting and Insights**
