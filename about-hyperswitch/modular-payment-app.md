# Modular Payment App

At Hyperswitch, we’ve revolutionized how businesses manage payments globally by offering a unified system that seamlessly connects merchants to multiple payment processors, fraud management tools, payout systems, and more. Initially designed as a comprehensive suite, our platform simplifies and optimizes the entire payment process through a single API.

As we collaborated with our merchants and gained a deeper understanding of their needs, we recognized that not every business seeks to build a full-stack payments infrastructure. Many aim to enhance their existing payments stack with capabilities like smart routing to boost authorization rates or reconciliation solutions to reduce payment operations overhead.

To address these needs, we introduced modularization, allowing Hyperswitch to be “unbundled” into independent, standalone services. This approach enables businesses to access and deploy precisely the features they need—such as fraud management, payment routing, or alternative payment method integrations—while maintaining the flexibility to scale with additional modules as their requirements evolve. Our modularized solution empowers merchants to tackle specific challenges effortlessly, ensuring seamless integration into their existing payment ecosystem.

### Why Modularization?

1. **Flexibility for Merchants**: You can integrate only the features you need, reducing complexity and costs.
2. **Scalable Solutions**: Our standalone modules enable you to address your immediate challenges and scale with more modules as needed.
3. **Non-Disruptive Integration**: Our modular solutions fit seamlessly into your existing payment ecosystems without requiring a complete system overhaul.
4. **Optimized Performance**: By focusing on specific challenges, you can use tailored solutions that maximize efficiency and boost results.
