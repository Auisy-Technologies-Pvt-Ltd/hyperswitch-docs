# Modular Payment App

At Juspay, we believe that payments infrastructure should be transparent, adaptable, and built for merchant control—not vendor lock-in. That’s why we made the bold decision to take our Payment Orchestrator open source.

Enterprise merchants operate in a world where payment agility is a competitive advantage. Traditional closed-loop platforms dictate their own rules, pricing, and pace of innovation. Based on our 12-years of experience building and scaling global payment systems, we decided to take a different approach—giving merchants the power to customize, optimize, and scale payments to fit their unique business needs.

Since our 2024 enterprise go-lives (e.g. Flowbird), we have been working on unbundling a range of stand-alone solutions from our broader technology stack to make them more accessible to merchants looking to expand their in-house system engineering capability. These stand-alone solutions range from services for intelligent / dynamic payment routing, payment methods vaulting, cost observability, PSP-agnostic authentication, and an APMs widget that can be embedded anywhere.

Hyperswitch is an Open Source payments stack offering  -&#x20;

* **Complete Transparency & Confidence**
* **Open roadmap, Open innovation**
* **Speed to market by building consensus faster**&#x20;

It is built on the principles of - **Modular, Composable, Well Architected**

* **Sub-systems**: To orchestrate a unified checkout, payment methods and credentials (tokens, PANs), trust providers, dynamic routing - across PSPs & acquirers, and debit networks, designed for redundancy & reliability, state-of-the-art transaction level payments intelligence to increase conversions and reduce costs, and to unify payment operations - observability, optimizations, reconciliation.
* **Modular**: Pick only the components you need—intelligent routing, vault, reconciliation, cost observability, smart retries, APM widgets—without overhauling your stack.
* **Scalable**: Ability to handle peakings transactions up to 5K TPS (horizontal scaling)
* **Reliable**: Ensuring zero downtime and safe mode for handling exceptions (with retries, multi-region, Active-active)
* **Observable**: Providing deep insights into transactions and failures (logging, monitoring, tracing, drill downs, audits, optimizations - auth-lift and cost reduction)
* **Composable**: Easily integrate Hyperswitch into any existing payments infrastructure, reducing migration friction.
* **Future-proof**: Swap out or upgrade internal systems and providers without rebuilding from scratch—a level of flexibility closed platforms can’t match.

In addition to the full-stack end-to-end payment orchestration, the different Hyperswitch modules

1. **Cost observability**\
   It is an advanced observability tool for payment cost optimization. It empowers businesses to uncover hidden cost-saving opportunities, review fees, downgrades & penalties, optimize processing strategies, and detect anomalies-all through a self-serve dashboard designed to Audit, Observe and Optimize payments costs.

2. **Revenue recovery**\
   It tackles passive churn by optimizing recurring payments with intelligent retry strategies tailored to diverse parameters like card bin, ticket size, region, payment method & 15 more. It integrates seamlessly with existing payment stacks and boosts recurring success rates while reducing penalties and operational complexities. It focuses on - Ease of integration, transparency of payment attempts and control - kind of retry algorithm, penalty budget, retry split and more. [Read more](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/explore-hyperswitch/payment-flows-and-management/subscriptions/revenue-recovery)
3. **Vault**\
   Payment Methods and Vaulting Service to securely store tokens, bank & wallet credentials and raw card details, ensuring data safety and compliance. It provides a unified view of all user-linked payment methods, enabling efficient management and seamless transaction experience for repeat users.
4. **Intelligent routing**\
   It maximizes First Attempt Authorization Rate (FAAR) by dynamically selecting the PSP with the highest auth rate, minimizing failures and reducing retries. It proactively prevents payment processor downtime impact, avoids excessive retry penalties, and eliminates unnecessary latency, ensuring a seamless payment experience. [Read more](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/explore-hyperswitch/payment-flows-and-management/smart-router/intelligent-routing)
5. **Reconciliation** \
   Simplify payment operations with a unified reconciliation framework for 2-way or 3-way reconciliation, with automated data fetching from multiple processors and banks. This module reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and provides clear visibility into payment data with features like - back-date and staggered recon, output customization and more. [Read more](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/explore-hyperswitch/account-management/reconciliation)
6. **Alternate payment methods**\
   Embeddable payment buttons for seamless one-click checkout with alternate payment methods like PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, Pay by Bank or BNPL providers like Klarna. The widget routes the transaction independently and dynamically to one or more connected PSPs, maximizing conversions.
