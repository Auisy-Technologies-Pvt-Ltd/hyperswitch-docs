## Steps to Deploy Hyperswitch on AWS

### **Prerequisites**

* `git` installed on your local machine
* node version 18
* An AWS user account with admin access (you can create an account [here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html?refid=em\_127222) if you do not have one)

### Step 1 - \[Optional] - Create a new user with Admin access (if you do not have a non-root user)

* Create a new user in your AWS account from [`IAM -> Users`](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-2#/users) (as shown below)
* While setting permissions, **provide admin access** to the user

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/aws user (1).gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Step 2 - Configure your AWS credentials in your terminal

For this step you would need the following from your AWS account

1. Preferred AWS region
2. Access key ID
3. Secret Access Key
4. Session Token (if you MFA set up)

You can create or manage your access keys from `IAM > Users` inside your AWS Console. For more information, [click here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id\_credentials\_access-keys.html#Using\_CreateAccessKey)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-11-02 at 5.48.06 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you have the keys run the below command

```json
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<Your AWS_REGION> // e.g., export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-2
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<Your Access_Key_Id> // e.g., export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<Your Secret_Access_Key> // e.g., export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="<Your AWS_SESSION_TOKEN>" //optional
```

### Step 3 - Deploy Hyperswitch application

Run the below commands in the same terminal session

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-cdk.git
cd hyperswitch-cdk
bash install.sh
```

Once the script is run you will have to provide the following as inputs

1. Provide a DB password of your choice (should be more than 8 chars)
2. Provide an Admin Api key of your choice for Hyperswitch APIs&#x20;
3. If you choose to opt-in for the card vault service, provide a master-key when prompted (command to generate the master-key will be displayed on the terminal; also note down the two custodian keys to start the locker)
   * Provide the Locker DB password of your choice when prompted

After the deployment is completed, use the custodian keys to activate the locker (You can find the cURLs [here](https://api-reference.hyperswitch.io/api-reference/key-custodian/unlock-the-locker)). The host URL of the locker to run these cURLs will be displayed on terminal

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure to save the passwords you provide while running the script
{% endhint %}

### Output

On successful execution of the script, you will receive the following outputs

| Output                      | What is it used for                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hostname of the app server  | Access the application's APIs using the given base URL                                                                                                   |
| Hostname of the log server  | View real-time logs for all processes                                                                                                                    |
| Control Center URL          | Access the Hyperswitch control center and explore multiple settings                                                                                      |
| Hyperloader.js URL          | Use the `hyperloader` to [integrate our web client](component-wise-deployment/deploy-web-client/integrate-web-client-on-your-web-app.md) in your website |
| Demo App URL                | Test payments quickly using our web checkout in the demo store                                                                                           |
| Locker URL                  | Access the Hyperswitch card vault using this host URL                                                                                                    |

{% hint style="success" %}
That's it! Hyperswitch should be up and running on your AWS account. Open the Demo Store and make a test transaction using any test card :tada::tada:
{% endhint %}

## **Estimated cost of running the above setup**

The table below offers an estimated cost for operating the setup generated by the CDK script within your AWS environment. This cost is computed under the following assumptions:

* &#x20;The system is handling a traffic of 1000 transactions per day
* The number of hours per month for each component is 720 (24\*30)

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th width="138">Component</th><th width="125">Instances</th><th width="164">Storage</th><th width="176">Throughput cost</th><th>Total Cost ($)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>EKS</td><td>1 cluster</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>EC2</td><td>3 x t3.medium</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>45.11</td></tr><tr><td>Aurora Postgresql</td><td>1 x t3.medium</td><td>500 MB * ( 0.05 USD) Assuming 30k transactions per month</td><td><p>0.07 USD **</p><p>(3 baseline i/o per minute, 9 peak i/o per minute) </p></td><td><p>59.98</p><p>(59.86 + 0.05 + 0.07)</p></td></tr><tr><td>ElastiCache</td><td>1 x t3.micro</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>12.24</td></tr><tr><td>S3</td><td>1</td><td>1 GB</td><td><p>0.24 ***</p><p>(290 GB outbound data transfer assuming 1000 new user logins per day)</p></td><td>1.14</td></tr><tr><td>Load Balancer</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>65.72</td></tr><tr><td><mark style="color:red;"><strong>Total</strong></mark></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><mark style="color:red;"><strong>257.19</strong></mark></td></tr></tbody></table>

\*Avg data written per transaction = 16 kb

\*\*Assuming 3.5k API requests per day with 5 i/o operations each and 18 hours peak time per day

\*\*\*Assuming 30 GET requests per login. Avg new user would receive 10 mb data per request. For 1000 new logins the data transfer = (10\*30\*1000\*) / 1024 \~ 290 GB
