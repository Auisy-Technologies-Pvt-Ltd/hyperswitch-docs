# 👋 Overview

## Hyperswitch and the payments ecosystem

Hyperswitch is a unified API to connect with dozens of different payment processors, each with very different internal APIs and SDKs. In other words, our payment switch is a set of payments domain abstractions, built over the capabilities of leading payment processors, wallets, Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) providers and banks.

Hyperswitch can simplify your payment integrations and allow you to take full control of your payments.

Using Hyperswitch, you can:

* 🚀 **Improve success rates** by 2-10% with seamless failover and auto-retries
* ⬇️ **Reduce dependency** on a single processor like Stripe or Braintree
* 🌐 **Increase business reach** with local/alternate payment methods
* 💸 **Reduce processing fees** by directly connecting to banks acquirers
* 🎨 **Customize payment flows** with full visibility and control
* 🧑‍💻 **Reduce Dev effort** to add & maintain integrations by 90%

The current payment landscape is extremely diverse, with 500+ payment processors, 200+ wallets, 130+ bank transfer options, local payment solutions and so on. Over the years, this has increased the number of fintech layers, resulting in more latency and cost associated with each transaction. In addition to this, connecting and maintaining multiple payment integrations requires a lot of development effort.

The payment ecosystem is:

* Dominated by closed systems and walled gardens
* Ever increasing diversity
* Becoming expensive for businesses
